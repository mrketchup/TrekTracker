When the Enterprise rescues the pilot, the Klingons attack with a new energy weapon and demand that the pilot be handed over to them.\nThe pilot turns out to be Cyrano Jones, an intergalactic trader well known to Kirk and crew from \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". The Klingons desperately want Jones for introducing the tribble to Klingon planets where it has become a major pest, and for stealing a glommer, an animal the Klingons were breeding to prey on the tribble.\nKirk expresses sympathy for the Klingons' plight but refuses to hand over Jones, a Federation citizen.\nJones is now selling tribbles genetically engineered to omit their ordinarily unrestrained multiplicative proclivities. Dr. McCoy discovers that although Jones' \"new\" tribbles don't reproduce, they still have ravenous appetites. Instead of reproducing, they now grow hugely fat.\nKirk and Spock manage to counter the Klingon weapon. Now at a disadvantage, the Klingons offer to settle for just the glommer. Kirk agrees and returns it\u2014along with several well-fed (and huge) tribbles that scare it away. McCoy injects the remaining tribbles on the Enterprise with a serum to slow down their metabolic rate. They are finally \"safe\".",
